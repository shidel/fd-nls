When listing languages for a specific program, the language maybe followed
by a special character. Those characters mean the translation file failed
a specific test.

  ? unable to locate default English version
  ! caution, English version is newer than translation
  + caution, has some extras keys and probably nothing to worry about
  * problem, has some missing keys

Also note, this utility does not scan the following directories:

  packages, fdi, htmlhelp

and does not compare 'txt, docinfo, htm, html, inc' file types or subdirectories.
