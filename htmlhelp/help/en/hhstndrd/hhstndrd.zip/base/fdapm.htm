<h1>Command: fdapm</h1>
<pre>
  FDAPM is an advanced Power Management tool.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  fdapm [Options]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
 (none)     If no options are given, default is to show both the
            INFO and the STATS output (if shell loaded, otherwise,
            when loaded through INSTALL, default is to do APMDOS).
  APMoff    Disable plain BIOS APM energy saving mode. MS POWER syntax
            compatibility alias: "OFF".
  OFF       Same as APMoff, for compatibility with MS power.
  APMbios   Enable plain BIOS APM energy saving mode. MS POWER syntax
            compatibility alias: "STD".
  STD       Same as APMbios, for compatibility with MS power.
  APMDOS    This should give you maximum energy savings. It is the
            only mode that causes FDAPM to stay resident in RAM.
            To stop, select APMbios/APMoff.
  ADV:MAX   Maximum energy savings, for compatibility with MS power.
  ADV:MIN   Minimum energy savings, for compatibility with MS power.
  ADV:REG   Restricted energy savings, for compatibility with MS power.
  INFO      Show information about APM status. Displays things like
            battery fill percentage.
  STATS     Show information about APM status / APMDOS. Displays things
            like CPU busy time percentage, if resident FDAPM or POWER is
            loaded in memory.
  FLUSH     Flushes the disk caches (writes back data to disk).
  SPINUP    Wakes up IDE disks again.
  SPINDOWN  Flushes the disk caches and stops IDE disks on the first 2
            IDE controllers. Use at your own risk. The disks will spin
            up again when you use them again. The disks have builtin 
            "intelligence" for that. To save energy automatically, you
            can often use a BIOS setup option which tells the disk at 
            boot time that it can spin down itself (it has a builtin
            timer!) whenever it has not been accessed for a while.
  ACPIOFF   As POWEROFF but explicitly uses ACPI instead of APM. Note that
            the classic functions will use ACPI, too, if no APM BIOS
            support is present. The system is placed into S5 soft-off
            after flushing caches and spinning down disks. Useful to
            compare APM / ACPI handling.
  STANDBY   Flushes the disk caches, enter stand-by mode. Requires APM or
            ACPI and an ATX or newer power supply.
  SUSPEND   Flushes the disk caches, stops (will auto wake up) IDE disks,
            suspends system. Useful if you have a BIOS with suspend to
            disk, to avoid spinning the disks right before suspend needs
            them. Requires APM or ACPI and an ATX or newer power supply.
  PURESUSP  As SUSPEND, but does not stop IDE disks first. Requires APM
            or ACPI and an ATX or newer power supply.
  POWEROFF  Flushes the disk caches, stop IDE disks, power off VGA and
            system. Requires APM or ACPI and an ATX or newer power supply.
  PUREOFF   As POWEROFF, but does not stop IDE disks first. Useful if your
            BIOS would otherwise wake up the disk right before cutting off
            power (ouch). Requires APM or ACPI and an ATX or newer power
            supply.
  VGAoff    Switches EGA/VGA DPMS screen off (no auto wake up!).You have
            to type FDAPM VGAon or to reboot to switch on. VGAoff is no
            screensaver. Use idledpms as screensaver instead.
  VGAon     Switches EGA/VGA DPMS screen on again. Just pressing a key
            after using the VGAoff function will NOT enable video again,
            this is not a screen saver. It is only a way to turn video on
            and off without any kind of system monitoring or automatic
            wakeup.
  ZapStats  Clear STATS counters.
  SPEEDn    Set system speed to n/8 (n * 12,5%) of max. (0 halts until 
            'power' pressed). Use SPEED9 to show current setting.
            SPEED9 is the recommended way to test if your system does
            use ACPI in a FDAPM compatible way. Requires ACPI.
  SPEED0    Speed 0 will put the system into S1 standby (press the ATX
            power or sleep button to continue) CPU-wise. None of the
            other devices will sleep. Use the PCISLEEP tool if you want
            to do experiments with PCI Power Management.
  COLDboot  Do a reboot with BIOS tests (POST) (after flushing the disk
            caches) by telling the 8042 keyboard controller to pulse
            the hardware reset circuits. Very similar to a real cold
            reboot - only in rare cases, pressing the reset button or
            power-cycling the computer will give you a "colder" reset.
  WARMboot  Do a reboot without BIOS tests (POST). Usually safe but can
            crash if you use incompatible protected mode software, like
            some versions of EMM386. Flushes the disk caches before
            rebooting.
  HOTboot   Try a reboot at once using int 19h (will often crash!).
            Before attempting the reboot, FDAPM tells caches to flush 
            (write back data to disk) themselves and waits for a moment.
  HELP      Shows the help.
  /?        Shows the help.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  FDAPM is a replacement for MS-DOS Power.
  APM: Advanced Power Management.
  ACPI: Advanced Configuration and Power Interface.
  ATX: Advanced Technology Extended.
  DPMS: Display Power Management Signaling.
  Please read fdapm.txt in the fdapm packet for more information.
  Case is irrelevant, "-" or "/" are not needed.
  All harddisk sleep/standby/off related options automatically add a
  delay to give the harddisk time to change state. All of those and all
  reboot related options tell caches to write back dirty buffers to
  disk before the real action begins.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  fdapm apmdos  gives you maximum energy savings
  fdapm speed2  sets speed to 2x12,5% = 25% of maximum speed e.g. for
                old games
