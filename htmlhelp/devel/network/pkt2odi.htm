<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - PKT2ODI</h1>
<pre>
  As an alternative to the more commonly used <a href="../network/odi_ins.htm#ccc">ODIPKT.COM</a> a few people
  may also like to try out Calderas PKT2ODI.EXE as packet driver to
  <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> converter. But we should be aware, that the license for Novell's
  WebSpyder (which applies to PKT2ODI.EXE) only allows to use the
  software for the purpose of evaluating it. For commercial users the
  evaluation period is restricted to 90 days. For non-commercial users
  evaluation is allowed for "a reasonable period" of time. (Just how
  reasonable can it be to evaluate this software in the 21st century?)
  Anyway, PKT2ODI.EXE will be started in <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a> with a command
  like this:
    LH C:\NETWORK\NWCLIENT\PKT2ODI.EXE /B:1 /I:69
  The "/B" option tells PKT2ODI.EXE which logical board it should use.
  Like explained above we have to choose the board that uses the <a href="../network/ethernet.htm">ETHERNET</a>
  II frame. In difference to <a href="../network/odi_ins.htm#ccc">ODIPKT</a>, PKT2ODI starts counting with "1",
  so if the NET.CFG looks like this example:
    --- NET.CFG ---
      Link Driver 3C574
        FRAME ETHERNET_II
        FRAME ETHERNET_802.2
        FRAME ETHERNET_802.3
        FRAME ETHERNET_SNAP
  we have to use the parameter
    PKT2ODI.EXE /B:1
  to define the use of the first board (the one with ETHERNET_II). Re-
  member that we have to use the board with Ethernet II, otherwise the
  converter won't be able to communicate with the driver and complain
  about not finding the MLID (Multiple Link Interface Driver).

  The second parameter, the "/I" sets the software interrupt (vector)
  used by the driver. We already found out that this should be 0x60, but
  unfortunately this won't work with PKT2ODI. The program doesn't accept
  interrupt vectors 0x60 to 0x68. We may use vector 0x69 with the para-
  meter:
    PKT2ODI.EXE /I:69
  Using an unusual interrupt vector like 0x69 can be a problem for some
  TCP/IP applications. They must be configured to use this vector. Some
  programs, like the webserver SIOUX, may not work correctly, if the
  vector is not 0x60.
  That's all. After starting the LSL (Link Support Layer), the MLID
  (Multiple Link Interface Driver) and the converter the packet driver
  interface should now be up and running.
