<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - Novell Netware</h1>
<pre>
  Novell, former market leader for local networks, provided "LAN WorkPlace
  for DOS" which also included a <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> protocol stack and numerous
  programs. Some software for DOS can still be downloaded from Novell's
  site and used for free:
    * <b>The NetWare <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> Client 16 Driver for MS-DOS</b> (1996)
      (http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tools/13555.html <b>(*01)</b>)
      and the <b>NetWare Client 32-Driver</b> (1998)
      (http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tools/downloads/dw271e.zip
      <b>(*02)</b>) allow DOS users to connect to a Novell NetWare Server.
    * Novell's <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">TCP/IP Kernel</a> <b>"TCP16.EXE"</b> (1996)
      (http://bbs.actapricot.org/files/area37/tcp16.exe <b>(*03)</b>) can still
      be used to run <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> applications directly over <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> (see chapter
  <a href="../network/others.htm">Others</a>). On the sites above Novell includes a warning that this soft-
  ware is neither maintained nor supported any longer.
  Useful information about Novell's DOS clients can still be found at the
  newsgroup <b>"novell.support.os.client.dos-win3x"</b>,
  <b>http://groups.google.it/group/novell.support.os.client.dos-win3x (*04)</b>
  which was active until 2004.
  More recent information and useful links can be found at <b>"DOS Solutions"</b>
  (http://www.dossolutions.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/network.htm#nware <b>(*05)</b>).
