<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - NFS</h1>
<pre>
  This document describes how to set up NFS networking on a DOS system
  with a <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> card, so that a DOS drive letter is mapped to a directory
  path on an NFS server (UNIX).
</pre>
<h2><a name="aaa"></a>Hardware</h2>
<pre>
  This has been tested on a server (486dx2-66s) running Red Hat Linux 5.2
  (kernel 2.0.36), using DOS clients on 4.77mhz 8088s, some 80286s, and
  various higher level machines, with NE2000 generic clone <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> cards.
  They all work fine. <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> was a 10base2 over coaxial cable, with 10-20
  systems on it, and one 10baseT hub for more recent machines.
</pre>
<h2><a name="bbb"></a>Software</h2>
<pre>
  Software was XFS. In the XFS80286 directory, find a FreeDOS file-set
  that runs on 80286 and above machines. In the XFS8088 directory, look
  for a 8088 file-set that runs on the oldest PCs.
</pre>
<h2><a name="ccc"></a>NFS server</h2>
<pre>
  On the Linux server, you will need to create (or modify) the /etc/
  exports file to export the necessary directory paths. For example,
  to share the /home/dos directory as read-write for all clients:
    /home/dos  (rw,insecure)
  In order to support remote printing, you will also need to start
  rpc.pcnfsd. You may need to modify the /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs script
  so that rpc.pcnfsd starts automatically at system boot.
  Note that pcnfsd is a small C program written by Sun, and is freely
  available on the Internet. If your server does not come with a
  version of pcnfsd, you will need to compile it and install into the
  /usr/sbin directory (use the same permissions as rpc.nfsd).

<h2><a name="ddd"></a>DOS client</h2>
<pre>
  <b>80286 and above</b>

  From the XFS software, look in the xfs80286 directory to support
  systems with an 80286 CPU and above. Copy this whole directory as-is
  to a directory on your hard drive. You will have to edit HOSTS, XFS.BAT
  - and perhaps <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a> and <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> - to use the correct path
  to XFS. To start your <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>, type:
    XFS
  You will see a character in the upper-right corner of your screen
  which indicates what XFS is trying to do:
   <b> A </b> running ARP request to get an IP address,
   <b> &gt; </b> sending packets to the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>,
   <b> &lt; </b> receiving packets from the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>

   <b>8088</b>

  From the XFS software, see the xfs8088 directory for 8088-specific
  support, and copy these files to your hard drive. Edit HOSTS and
  XFS.BAT to use the new paths.
  The oldest 4.77 MHz 8088 PCs work just fine. However, a special driver
  is needed on the 8088, because the original <a href="../network/crynwr.htm">Crynwr</a> packet driver makes
  three 80286 instructions.) I patched that driver and renamed it
  ne2000b8.com. Load the new driver. You also need files from a special
  8088-only version of the XFS package (xt-191.zip).
  Originally, there was an NE1000 card for 8088s. These have all but
  disappeared. All the NE2000 cards we tested worked just fine on the
  8088, even when the 16-bit card is inserted in an 8-bit ISA slot. Some
  of the newer NE cards may need to be set up in a 80286 or above before
  being put into 8088s.
  Only tested with MS-DOS; FreeDOS COMMAND.COM does not support
  8088 CPUs. MS-DOS versions 3.20, 5.00, and 6.22 all tested ok.
</pre>
<h2><a name="eee"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
<pre>
  Most problems we experienced were due to bad <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> cables or inter-
  rupt problems. Before starting, ensure your network is available (test
  using ping from one Linux box to another.)
  On the DOS boxes, we set all the NE2000 cards to the 0x300 address,
  and then picked an unused interrupt and set the card and the driver
  line to match (please see the "ne2000" line in XFS.BAT.)
  With a little playing around, you should have your first DOS client
  using NFS very quickly.
  For other problems, see the documentation in the XFS191.ZIP and
  xt-191.zip files. Most Linux servers have similar documentation about
  NFS, which may help set up the server.
