<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - DOS networking
today</h1>
<h2><a name="zzz"></a>Overview</h2>
<pre>
  In this chapter we will learn more about the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> drivers, protocols
  and <a href="../network/network.htm">networking</a> software that can be used with a FreeDOS PC in the 21st
  century. For deeper information about <a href="../network/network.htm">networking</a> try Eugene Blanchard's
  <b>"Introduction to Data Communications"</b> (see:
  <b>http://www.techbooksforfree.com/intro_to_data_com/ (*01)</b>, GNU GPL,
  a more recent but non free version <b>can be found here</b>, see:
  http://learnat.sait.ab.ca/ict/txt_information/Intro2dcRev2/index.html
  <b>(*02)</b>.

<h2><a name="aaa"></a>Drivers</h2>
<pre>
  <a href="../network/ethernet.htm">Ethernet</a> is today's dominant <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> hardware technology. For this type
  of <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> adapters generally three sorts of drivers can be used under
  DOS (and you should be able to find at least one of them for your
  card):
    * <a href="../network/install.htm">Packet drivers</a>, invented by FTP Software Inc. Many of them were
      written and distributed by <a href="../network/crynwr.htm">Crynwr</a>.
    * Open Datalink Interface (<a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a>) drivers, developed by <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a> and
      Apple and the
    * <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> Driver Interface Specification (<a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>) drivers, developed by
      Microsoft and <a href="../network/3com.htm">3Com</a>.
  All three are <b>multiprotocol</b> <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> drivers, which means that they are
  able to support multiple protocols over the same card. Earlier drivers
  did support only a single protocol. Multiprotocol drivers communicate
  directly with the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> interface card and provide a published
  interface specification, to which applications can be written.
  For a good general introduction into this topic see <b>"Implementing
  Multi-Protocol <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> Drivers in a DOS Environment"</b> by the University
  of Georgia, Athens, Georgia (U.S.),see:
  http://www.eits.uga.edu/~ucns/lans/docs/netdrive.html <b>(*03)</b>.
</pre>
<h2><a name="bbb"></a>Protocols</h2>
<pre>
  The following protocols are supported by these three drivers:
    * Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (<a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>) used for
      instance by UNIX, GNU/Linux, Windows Vista, OS X and the Internet,
    * Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (<a href="../network/ipxspx.htm">IPX/SPX</a>)
      protocols, used for instance by <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell Netware</a>,
    * <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> Basic Input Output System (<a href="../network/history.htm#aaa">NetBIOS</a>) Extended User Interface
      (NetBEUI a.k.a. <a href="../network/cifs.htm">CIFS</a>) protocol used for instance by OS/2,
      Windows 9x, ME and 2000.
  <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> is the standard for basic internet services such as http,
  smtp or ftp and it also became the default protocol for connecting
  Local Area <a href="../network/network.htm">Networks</a> (LAN).
  <a href="../network/cifs.htm">NetBEUI</a> was the default protocol for LANs in Microsoft systems until
  Windows 2000. It was replaced by <a href="../network/history.htm#aaa">NetBIOS</a> over <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> (NBT) and then by
  <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>. The application level <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> protocol <a href="../network/history.htm#aab">SMB</a> for instance <b>can run</b>
  directly atop of TCP since Windows XP, see:
  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q204279 <b>(*04)</b>.
  <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell's</a> <a href="../network/ipxspx.htm">IPX</a> was used in <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell Netware</a>, which has been the default net-
  working solution for personal computers running DOS or Windows 3.x.
  Since 1998 NetWare is able to run on <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>, more recent versions use
  it per default.
  Conclusion: <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> is the "lingua franca" of modern <a href="../network/network.htm">networks</a>. It is
  still possible to use other protocols, but support may come to an end.

<h2><a name="ccc"></a>Networking software</h2>
<pre>
  In general we can distinguish the following three ways of networking
  that still can be used with DOS. Learn more about them in the following
  chapters:
    * <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell Netware</a> - <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> driver based <b>Novell NetWare</b> programs for
      accessing a NetWare <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> and using <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> services.
    * <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client</a> - <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a> driver based <b>Microsoft "<a href="../network/history.htm#aab">LAN manager</a> Client" or "MS
      Client 3.0"</b> to integrate DOS machines into a Windows/<a href="../network/history.htm#aab">SMB</a> workgroup.
    * <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP applications</a> - Packet driver based "UNIX-like" <b>TCP/IP appli-
      cations</b> to access or provide <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> services like http, smtp, ftp,
      SSH (see: <a href="../network/tcpip_ap.htm#eee">SSH2DOS</a>) or <a href="../network/nfs.htm">NFS</a>.
    * <a href="../network/others.htm">Others</a>
