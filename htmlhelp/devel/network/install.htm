<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - Installation</h1>
<pre>
  The majority of TCP/IP applications for DOS uses the packet driver
  interface. So to be able to run them, we need to install the appropriate
  drivers first.
  To install a generic packet driver is the simplest way. But it isn't
  always possible, as modern <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> cards often only come with <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a>- and
  <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a> drivers. Anyway: <a href="../network/odi_ins.htm">ODI</a>- or <a href="../network/ndis_ins.htm">NDIS</a> drivers can also be used as packet
  drivers through special converters ("shims"). This is just a bit more
  complicated.
  The following chapters describe where to obtain drivers and converters
  and how to configure them:
    *  <a href="../network/pack_ins.htm">Packet driver installation</a>
    *  <a href="../network/odi_ins.htm">ODI driver installation</a>
    *  <a href="../network/ndis_ins.htm">NDIS driver installation</a>
