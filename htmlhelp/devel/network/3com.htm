<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - 3Com</h1>
<pre>
  If your 3Com NIC is not supported by the <a href="../network/crynwr.htm">Crynwr</a> packet drivers, you
  can find a driver here:
  ftp://ftp.3com.com/pub/nic/3c90x/3c90x2.exe <b>(*01)</b>
  This is EtherCD v5.4, disk 2 of 2 for the <b>3C90x</b> adapter family. Disk 2
  contains DOS <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> and <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a> drivers, packet driver, help files, and DOS
  diagnostics.  This is a self-extracting DOS executable. After executing
  it, go into the PKTDVR subdirectory, and run 3C90XPD.COM. This should
  auto-detect your NIC, which may take a while, and install the packet
  driver in the first available interrupt vector, starting with 0x60.
  The interrupt vector can also specified with /I; see /? for details.
  You will want to add this to your <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a>.
  Afterwards, you can configure and use any <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a> application, such as
  SSH (see: <a href="../network/tcpip_ap.htm#eee">SSH2DOS</a>) and <a href="../network/tcpip_ap.htm#ccc">Arachne</a>. Use this in your WATTCP.CFG to
  specify the interrupt vector:
    pkt.vector = 0x60
