<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking with FreeDOS - Conclusion</h1>
<pre>
  There are a lot of networking applications for FreeDOS-Users available,
  some freeware, some even as Free Software. This is good news: <b>From
  serving files to surfing the web - anything is possible with FreeDOS.</b>
  There are downsides though: A seamless integration into other operating
  systems <a href="../network/network.htm">networks</a> is hard to achieve. Neither modern <a href="../network/history.htm#aab">SMB</a> (Windows- and
  GNU/Linux <a href="../network/network.htm">networks</a>) nor <a href="../network/nfs.htm">NFS</a> (GNU/Linux, UNIX) <a href="../network/network.htm">networks</a> are working
  without flaws with a DOS machine.
  And modern network interface cards almost stopped supporting packet
  drivers which once were the default drivers for DOS <a href="../network/network.htm">networking</a>. Other
  drivers need extra software which is not free and can not be distributed
  freely. So there is still a lot to do - for developers, but also for
  people who want to help with this documentation:
    * PPP is not explained - does someone still own a <a href="../network/modem.htm">Modem</a>?
    * A guide for using FreeDOS with <a href="../network/wifi.htm">WiFi</a> (wireless LAN) would be great.
    * <a href="../network/nfs.htm">NFS</a> isn't covered yet.
    * <a href="../network/network.htm">Networking</a> FreeDOS inside a virtual machine is not explained here.
    * A deeper look at <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client</a> could help a lot of users.
    * It isn't documented yet how <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell Netware</a> can be used with FreeDOS.
  As this is a wiki now, you are welcome to add information and continue
  this work. Have fun.
