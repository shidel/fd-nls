<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - Others</h1>
<pre>
  While the mentioned categories about networking DOS systems should
  cover most programs, there are a few exceptions. One of them is
  <b>"Invisible LAN"</b>, (see: <b>http://www.invisiblesoft.com/invlan/index.shtml</b>)
  a NetWare-like DOS application that even comes with an own protocol
  called "TransBIOS".
  Another special solution for quick getting a <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> up and running are
  network bootdisks. They are able to work with a broad range of hardware
  and use multiple protocols. Bootdisks are mostly used for backup,
  restore and repair. They can be extremely helpful.
  Examples are:
    * <b>Bart's <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> Boot Disk</b>, see:
      http://www.nu2.nu/bootdisk/network/ <b>(*01)</b>.
    * <b>Drivesnapshot</b> (see: <b>http://drivesnapshot.de/en/index.htm (*02)</b>).
    * <b>Netbootdisk</b> (see: <b>http://www.netbootdisk.com/ (*03)</b>).
  The legal situation is unfortunate: Some packages seem to include
  files from <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client</a>, while Microsoft's license does not allow such
  distribution.
