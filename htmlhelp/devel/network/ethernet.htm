<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - Ethernet</h1>
<pre>
  Ethernet is a family of frame-based computer <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> technologies for
  local area <a href="../network/network.htm">networks</a> (LANs). The name comes from the physical concept of
  the ether. <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> Interface Cards (NICs), such as <a href="../network/3com.htm">3Com</a> and others, can
  be found for varying different <a href="../network/network.htm">networks</a>. The most common is Ethernet
  (in various flavors) Token Ring and Arcnet. NICs are most commonly
  available for PCI, but older ISA cards may still be available. Most
  recent PCs have <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> interfaces built onto the motherboard.
  Laptops typically also support wireless <a href="../network/network.htm">networking</a>, or <a href="../network/wifi.htm">WiFi</a>.
  An Ethernet connection is the easiest method of using ADSL via a <a href="../network/modem.htm">Modem</a>
  or router. Though it may be possible to use a USB driver it would be
  more difficult.
  If you choose ethernet, you will need a supported driver, such as
  <a href="../network/crynwr.htm">Crynwr</a>, <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> or <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>. The most common protocol is <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>, but many
  <a href="../network/network.htm">networks</a> also support <a href="../network/ipxspx.htm">IPX/SPX</a>. To share data with other systems, you
  will need <a href="../network/nfs.htm">NFS</a> or <a href="../network/cifs.htm">CIFS</a>.
