<h1><a name="top" id="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - Introduction</h1>
<pre>
  Thanks to Mr. Ulrich Hansen for his permission to publish this article
  in the FreeDOS help!
</pre>
<h2><a name="zzz" id="zzz"></a>Summary</h2>
<pre>
  This document describes how to <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> a computer running FreeDOS
  (<b>http://www.freedos.org/</b>). Most things are supposed to work with other
  versions of DOS as well.
  The <a href="../network/history.htm">first chapter</a> is about the history of DOS <a href="../network/network.htm">networking</a>, which mostly
  happened in the years 1981 to 1995. In the <a href="../network/dosnetto.htm">second chapter</a> you find an
  overview over the drivers, protocols and applications that are still
  around in the 21st century. The <a href="../network/install.htm">third</a> and <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">fourth chapter</a> finally
  explain how to install <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> to a DOS machine. It is a detailed guide
  through the installation and configuration of drivers and other
  required software.
</pre>
<h2><a name="aaa" id="aaa"></a>Alternatives</h2>
<pre>
  If there is a LPT port available on both machines you also can use a
  parallel cable connection to transfer files (f.i. with MS DOS 6.22
  Interlnk, Open/DR DOS Filelink, Laplink, Winlink or <b>FileMaven</b>, see:
  <b>http://www.briggsoft.com/fmdos.htm (*01)</b>).
</pre>

<pre>
    (Picture Testsuite for this Wiki: A Compaq Contura Aero 4/33C with
    PCMCIA)
  To connect to a <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> you need some physical device to allow a
  connection between your PC and the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>. This can be done:
    * via <a href="../network/modem.htm">Modem</a>, using the phone line or
    * via an <a href="../network/ethernet.htm">Ethernet</a> network card, using direct wiring or
    * via <a href="../network/wifi.htm">WiFi</a>.

  <a href="../network/modem.htm">Modem</a>
  Networking via <a href="../network/modem.htm">Modem</a> is not yet described in this Wiki - maybe you want
  to help?

  <a href="../network/ethernet.htm">Ethernet</a>
  If you are considering buying an <a href="../network/ethernet.htm">Ethernet</a> card for your FreeDOS
  machine, look if it comes with a packet driver. Many <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>
  applications for DOS need a packet driver to work (see <a href="../network/pack_ins.htm">here</a> for more
  info). If the card comes with other drivers for DOS or Windows 3.1 like
  <a href="../network/odi_ins.htm">ODI drivers</a> (<a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a>) or <a href="../network/ndis_ins.htm">NDIS2 drivers</a> (Microsoft), they will also work
  in DOS (they are just a bit more complicated to install).
  If you use PCMCIA, the following cards are reported to work:
    * The <a href="../network/3com.htm">3Com</a> Megahertz 3C574 10/100 LAN PC Card (no packet driver, but
      with <a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> and <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>2),
    * the <a href="../network/3com.htm">3Com</a> EtherLink III 3C589 10 MiB Card (with packet driver) and
    * the D-Link DFE-670TXD Fast <a href="../network/ethernet.htm">Ethernet</a> PC Card (with packet driver).
  PCMCIA cards need to be installed with 3rd party software like
  SystemSofts CardSoft. It can be downloaded from driverguide as "System
  Soft Version 3.1, <b>CARDSOFT.ZIP</b>", see:
  http://www2.driverguide.com/uploads/uploads9/26188.html <b>(*02)</b>

  <a href="../network/wifi.htm">WiFi</a>
  Some older <a href="../network/wifi.htm">WiFi</a> cards work with FreeDOS. See <a href="../network/wifi.htm">here for more information</a>.

<h2><a name="ccc" id="ccc"></a>Remarks</h2>
<pre>
  Writing this document has only been possible because many other people
  were willing to share information and code on the internet. Thanks!
  Some parts of this document were inspired by Michael Bernardi's <b>DOS
  Networking HOWTO</b>, <b>http://www.dendarii.co.uk/FAQs/dos-net.html (*03)</b>.
  Also his collections of <b>FAQs</b> <b>http://www.dendarii.co.uk/FAQs/ (*04)</b>
  and <b>networking applications</b>, see:
  <b>http://www.dendarii.co.uk/FAQs/dos-apps.html (*05)</b>
  and his <b>DOS-Meta FAQ about networking DOS machines</b>, see:
  <b>http://www.dendarii.co.uk/FAQs/dos-meta_faq.html (*06)</b>
  are of great value.
  Another nice introduction into DOS networking was written by Michael
  B. Brutman. The title: <b>"<a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> Networking on DOS. Why on Earth would
  anybody want to do that?"</b> See:
  <b>http://www.brutman.com/Dos_Networking/dos_networking.html (*07)</b>.
