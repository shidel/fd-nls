<h1>Command: locate</h1>
<pre>
  LOCATE is a file finder for DOS.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  LOCATE [filespec] [options]
         The filespec may contain a drive letter, directory name, or
         both. If a drive letter is specified, only that drive will be
         searched. If no drive is specified, Locate will decide for itself
         which drives to search.
         Everything before the last backslash in the filespec is assumed
         to be the name of a directory to search; Locate will search that
         directory and any subdirectories it contains. If a directory name
         is specified, but no drive letter, the directory is assumed to
         be on the current drive; only the current drive will be searched.
         Wildcards are not permitted in the directory name.
