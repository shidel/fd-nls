<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - Packet driver
installation</h1>
<h2><a name="zzz"></a>Overview</h2>
<pre>
    (Picture of Packet driver)
  Packet drivers work as an interface between the hardware (the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>
  interface card) and the <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">TCP/IP Kernel</a> (which is also called "protocol
  stack"). One sort of <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">TCP/IP Kernels</a> work as an external program that
  can be called and used by various <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> applications. Other <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">TCP/IP</a>
  Kernels are already built into <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> applications, a web browser for
  instance or a ftp-client. We will learn more about these kernels
  <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">a bit further</a> in this wiki.
  Most of us will use the packet driver for <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> networking. And
  that's it. But packet drivers are multiprotocol drivers - so <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>
  isn't the only kernel that can work atop of it. As you can see in the
  figure above (in the dark grey fields), it is also possible to run
  <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a> NetWare over of a packet driver: Specialized drivers like
  IPXPD.COM or PDIPX.COM support IPX over the packet driver interface.
  The <a href="../network/cifs.htm">NetBEUI</a> protocol can't be used on top of a packet driver though,
  as the packet driver interface is too different from <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>.

<h2><a name="aaa"></a>Where to find them</h2>
<pre>
  The first place to look for a packet driver should be the installation
  medium that came with your card. Packet drivers often have the letters
  "PD" in their names, so the packet driver of a <a href="../network/3com.htm">3Com</a> 3C589 PC-Card is
  called "3C589PD.COM" and the driver of the D-Link DFE-670TXD PC-Card
  is called "DFE670PD.COM". Look for a directory "PKTDRV" on the CD or
  floppy that came with your card.
  If there is no such driver on your installation medium or you don't
  have any, try searching the web. For ISA and PCI <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> cards there
  is a chance a packet driver can be found at Russell Nelson's <a href="../network/crynwr.htm">Crynwr</a>
  website (see: <b>http://www.crynwr.com/project (*01)</b>) - a resource of
  public domain packet drivers. PCMCIA drivers seem to be rare there,
  though.
  Georg Potthast provides a collection of PCI card packet drivers (see:
  <b>http://www.georgpotthast.de/sioux/packet.htm (*02)</b>) and a tool called
  NICSCAN.EXE (see: <b>http://www.georgpotthast.de/sioux/pktdrv/nicscan.zip
  (*03)</b>) to determine the chipset of PCI <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> cards. He made the
  experience that packet drivers are often the same for a large number
  of models by the same manufacturer, so he recommends not to try
  finding a packet driver specific for your model number.

<h2><a name="bbb"></a>Installing a packet driver</h2>
<pre>
  To <a href="../network/install.htm">install</a> a packet driver, add a line like this to your <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a>
  (example for the 3c589 PCMCIA card):
    LH 3C589PD.COM 0x60 5 0x300
  In the example above the driver is loaded into high memory by using the
  command "LH". The first option ("0x60") sets the software interrupt
  (vector) used by the driver. The most frequently used packet driver
  software interrupt number is 0x60. The second option ("5") sets the
  IRQ, the third option ("0x300") sets the I/O port. Some drivers only
  need the vector and find the other values by themselves. Most packet
  drivers can be unloaded after use with the option "-u".

<h2><a name="ccc"></a>Reboot</h2>
<pre>
  That's all. You don't need any other driver (<a href="../network/odi.htm">ODI</a> or <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>). After
  successfully installing a packet driver, you can now install your
  <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> applications with an internal kernel (<a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a>) or install an
  external <a href="../network/ldtcpipk.htm">TCP/IP Kernel</a> (<a href="../network/ntcpdrv.htm">NTCPDRV</a>).
