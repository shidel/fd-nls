<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - ODI</h1>
<pre>
  The Open Data-Link Interface (ODI), developed by Apple and <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a>,
  serves the same function as Microsoft and <a href="../network/3com.htm">3Com's</a> <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a> to provide
  <a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> connectivity. Originally <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a> combined the driver and
  protocols together in one monolithic program, but in 1991 developed
  the ODI driver specification, which, with modification, is still in
  use today. This allows a single hardware specific driver to be written
  and used with multiple different protocols. Most manufacturers will
  write ODI drivers and <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a> have many available for download.
  Configuration is fairly straightforward using a text file called
  NET.CFG.
