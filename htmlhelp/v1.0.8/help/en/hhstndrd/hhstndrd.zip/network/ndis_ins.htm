<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - NDIS driver installation</h1>
<h2><a name="zzz"></a>Overview</h2>
<pre>
    (Picture: Overview of the NDIS architecture)
  Drivers based on the "<a href="../network/network.htm">Network</a> Driver Interface Specification" (<a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>)
  are the default in the Windows world. The most recent version is <a href="../network/ndis.htm">NDIS</a>
  6 which is used in Windows Vista. Windows 98 used NDIS 5, Windows 95
  came with NDIS 3.1. In DOS you have to use the real-mode driver NDIS2.
</pre>
<h2><a name="aaa"></a>Where to find them</h2>
<pre>
  It is most likely a NDIS driver exists for your <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> card. Look for
  a directory called "NDIS2" in your cards installation files. If you
  can't find a driver, take a look at this site (see: <b>http://
  drivesnapshot.de/en/makebootdisk.htm (*01)</b>). The ending of the driver
  name has to be *.DOS, so for instance the driver of the <a href="../network/3com.htm">3Com</a> 3C574
  PC-Card is called "EL3C574.DOS".
</pre>
<h2><a name="bbb"></a>How they work</h2>
<pre>
  In the language of the NDIS architecture these drivers are called
  <b>"Media Access Control" (MAC)</b> drivers.
  The <b>MAC</b> driver is only one component of the NDIS architecture as you
  can see in the figure above. According to the NDIS 2.1 documentation
  (see: <b>http://www.ndis.com/faq/ndis201.txt (*02)</b>) NDIS seems to work
  like that:
    * Commands in <a href="../cnfigsys/fdconfig.htm">FDCONFIG.SYS</a> (FreeDOS) or <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> (other DOS) load
      the Protocol Manager driver PROTMAN.DOS, the <b>MAC</b> driver and the
      protocol driver. This can be done by lines for each of these drivers
      or by starting the "Installable File System Helper" driver, which
      is loaded by "DEVICEHIGH=IFSHLP.SYS" and starts the Protocol
      Manager, the <b>MAC</b> and the protocol drivers according to
      PROTOCOL.INI.
    * The Protocol Manager reads the configuration from PROTOCOL.INI and
      makes them available to the <b>MAC</b> driver and protocol driver which
      load after it.
    * The <b>MAC</b> driver and the protocol driver load and configure
      themselves according to that information. They identify themselves
      to the Protocol Manager.
    * Before <b>MAC</b> driver and protocol driver can communicate, they have
      to be bound together, so they can access each others "entry points"
      (communication ports). This bind process is controlled by the
      Protocol Manager based on information in PROTOCOL.INI.
    * The binding sequence can be triggered by NET.EXE or NETBIND.COM
      (which can be done in <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a>).
    * The Protocol Manager (PROTMAN.DOS) then starts the memory resident
      (Terminate and Stay Resident - TSR) program PROTMAN.EXE to execute
      the bind command and to control the correct ordering of drivers.
    * After binding has occurred, the <b>MAC</b> and the protocol driver communi-
      cate directly to each other. The Protocol Manager is not involved
      in this communication process any longer, so NETBIND.COM frees most
      of the memory previously reserved by the Protocol Manager.
  The configuration of NDIS under DOS has changed over time with different
  versions of the package. Some hints about the differences can be found
  here (see: <b>http://www.yale.edu/pclt/WINWORLD/NDIS.HTM (*03)</b>). In this
  document, I am assuming that we use the NDIS files shipped with
  <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client</a> 3.0.
  As this section is all about getting packet driver based <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> appli-
  cations up and running with DOS we will not go into details about
  <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client</a> here, this is already explained elsewhere.
</pre>
<h2><a name="ccc"></a>Additional files needed</h2>
<pre>
  So how can we use the NDIS2 <b>MAC</b> driver that came with our <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>
  interface card for <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> networking? As we have learned from the
  description above, we need some more files. These are:
    * The Protocol Manager ("PROTMAN.DOS" and "PROTMAN.EXE")
    * The bind utility ("NETBIND.COM")
  These files are part of the <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client</a> 3.0 which can be downloaded here:
    <b>ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/Clients/MSCLIENT/DSK3-1.EXE (*04)</b>
    <b>ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/Clients/MSCLIENT/DSK3-2.EXE (*05)</b>
  The three files mentioned are part of "DSK3-1.EXE". Use the utility
  "EXPAND.EXE" included on the first disk to uncompress these files.
    * Copy DSK3-1.EXE to a directory like C:\MSCLIENT1. Avoid a long path
      if you do this in Windows. 16-bit software won't execute, if the
      path is too long.
    * Run DSK3-1.EXE to unpack its content.
    * Decompress PROTMAN.DO_ and PROTMAN.EX_.

  expand -r protman.do_
  expand -r protman.ex_

    * NETBIND.COM is already uncompressed. Now you can take and use the
      three files.
  Read the LICENSE.TXT file before you start using the files. The software
  is free for internal use. Neither the distribution nor a modification
  is allowed.
</pre>
<h2><a name="ddd"></a>The converter/shim</h2>
<pre>
  The last piece we need is the <b>"Packet Driver to NDIS Converter"</b>. Get the
  widely used "DIS_PKT9.DOS" (version 9, see: <b>ftp://ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca/
  software/pc_network/dis_pkt9.zip (*06)</b>) or alternatively the slightly
  newer (version 11) "DIS_PKT.DOS"(see: <b>http://danlan.com/pdr_shim/odipkt/
  odipkt.zip (*07)</b>). There are no differences in usage and handling.
  Both were written by Prof. Joe R. Doupnik (Utah State University) and
  Dan Lanciani (Harvard University). The copyright holds the now historic
  FTP Software, Inc., which luckily released this driver as public
  domain, free for use, distribution, change and with sourcecode.
</pre>
<h2><a name="eee"></a>Configuration of NDIS drivers</h2>
<pre>
  As I already mentioned, this is just a minimal <a href="../network/install.htm">installation</a> of the
  <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client</a> 3.0. The only purpose is to use packet-driver-based <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a>
  applications. For this purpose:
    Copy the four files
      PROTMAN.DOS
      PROTMAN.EXE
      NETBIND.COM
      DIS_PKT.DOS
  into a directory, for instance C:\NET.
  Copy also the <b>MAC driver</b> of your <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> interface card, for instance:
      EL3C574.DOS
  into this directory.
  Now we have to create the configuration file needed for the NDIS
  architecture: Create a file with the name PROTOCOL.INI inside the
  C:\NET directory. For our minimal configuration it just needs the
  following lines:
      --- PROTOCOL.INI ---
      [protman]
      DriverName=PROTMAN$
      [EL3C574]
      DriverName=EL3C574$
      [PKTDRV]
      drivername=PKTDRV$
      bindings=EL3C574
      intvec=0x60
      chainvec=0x68
  <b>Explanation of the parameters:</b>
  Like other *.ini files, PROTOCOL.INI is structured into section names
  in square brackets and item names with values assigned to them.
    [protman]
    DriverName=PROTMAN$
  The first section [protman] defines the Protocol Manager. Like
  described above, the Protocol Manager is loaded as driver PROTMAN.DOS
  which is called "PROTMAN$" here. Section and line are mandatory.
    [EL3C574]
    DriverName=EL3C574$
  The section [EL3C574] defines the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> interface card. By default
  the section itself is named after the card - this is useful, if you
  have more than one <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> card and use different sections for
  different cards. So the section name is the first value to change
  here. It would be a good idea to name it after your own <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> card.
  But you may as well rename the section to "netcard", "NIC" or even
  "baked_beans" - whatever you like, as long as you also change all the
  other lines in PROTOCOL.INI that point to that section.
  The next line of this section is "DriverName=EL3C574$". It defines the
  driver for the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> interface card. In our example this is
  EL3C574.DOS, which is called "EL3C574$" here. Most certainly you will
  use a different NIC than the one mentioned in the example. So you will
  have to change this line. You find the correct name of the driver in
  a text-file called "PROTOCOL.INI" that should be part of the NDIS
  driver files supplied with your card.
  It is also possible to add more lines to this section, so you can define
  special settings for your <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> card. Consult the "PROTOCOL.INI"
  supplied with your NDIS driver for more information. But in many cases
  the line with the drivername should be enough.
    [PKTDRV]
    drivername=PKTDRV$
    bindings=EL3C574
    intvec=0x60
    chainvec=0x68
  The next section "[PKTDRV]" defines our Packet Driver to NDIS
  Converter, which is "DIS_PKT.DOS" or "DIS_PKT9.DOS". Both are called
  by the name "PKTDRV$".
  It is important that the converter will bind to the driver of the
  <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> card. This is done by the next line "bindings=EL3C574". Please
  note that this name includes <b>no</b> "$" letter - it refers to the
  <b>name of the section</b> that defines the driver, not to the driver itself.
  So if you had called this section "[baked_beans]" as suggested above,
  you'd have to write "bindings=baked_beans" here ;-).
  The item "intvec" specifies the software interrupt vector used by the
  packet driver interface. As already explained, this should be the
  hexadecimal value 0x60 per default.
  The "chainvec" item also defines an available software interrupt. Its
  function is still a mystery to me. According to packet driver inventor
  (see: <b>http://groups.google.de/group/comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc/msg/
  17b6041f7a3cde7c?dmode=source (*08)</b>) FTP, adding a chain vector
  interrupt may improve packet processing speed and reliability. Users
  saw "a 10-fold increase in performance" (see: <b>http://groups.google.de/
  group/comp.protocols.nfs/msg/9b0c2e0d6aa47b32?dmode=source (*09)</b>).
  To avoid EMM386 errors, some recommend (see: <b>http://groups.google.de/
  group/bit.listserv.banyan-l/msg/aa961def5901f506?dmode=source (*10)</b>)
  to set an interrupt that increases the vector by decimal 8. So if the
  <b>intvec</b> is 0x60 (that is decimal 96), then the <b>chainvec</b> should be
  decimal 104 (96+8) which is hexadecimal 0x68. This is also described
  (see: <b>http://groups.google.de/group/comp.protocols.tcp-ip.ibmpc/
  msg/64f2b6060ff2b438?dmode=source (*11)</b>) by one of the authors of
  DIS_PKT.DOS, Dan Lanciani. Please write if you find out more.
  These are all settings in PROTOCOL.INI needed for our purpose. A last
  hint: If you consider changing some of these values at each boot, for
  instance by choices presented by a DOS boot menu, you may find Horst
  Schaeffer's freeware "Inifile" helpful (see: <b>http://www.horstmuc.de/
  wbat32.htm (*12)</b>).
</pre>
<h2><a name="fff"></a>Installation</h2>
<pre>
  The last thing left to do now is to load the drivers at boot. So
  change your system files to contain the following lines:
    --- <a href="../cnfigsys/fdconfig.htm">FDCONFIG.SYS</a> (FreeDOS) ---
    --- or <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS</a> (MS DOS/other DOS) ---
    DEVICEHIGH=C:\NET\PROTMAN.DOS /I:C:\NET
    DEVICEHIGH=C:\NET\EL3C574.DOS
    DEVICEHIGH=C:\NET\DIS_PKT.DOS
  The "/I" parameter tells the Protocol Manager the location of
  PROTOCOL.INI. This is not needed if both are in the same directory.
    --- <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a> ---
    C:\NET\NETBIND.COM
  Note that NETBIND.COM can not be loaded high and should just be exe-
  cuted from <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a>. If you try to load it like a driver, it will
  abort with the message "run-time error R6009 - not enough space for
  environment".
</pre>
<h2><a name="ggg"></a>Reboot</h2>
<pre>
  That's all. Reboot the system and use a simple <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> application
  like ping to test if everything is working.
