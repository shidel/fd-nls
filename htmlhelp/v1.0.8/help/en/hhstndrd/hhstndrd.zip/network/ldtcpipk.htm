<h1><a name="top"></a>Networking FreeDOS - Loading the TCP/IP Kernel (Stack)</h1>
<h2><a name="zzz"></a>Overview</h2>
<pre>
  Modern operating systems have their own <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> kernel already built-in:
  Microsoft systems come with "Winsock" since Windows 95. In GNU/Linux
  the TCP/IP stack is part of the Linux kernel. DOS however comes without
  kernel. So after we had installed our packet driver, we have to give
  the TCP/IP kernel a thought.   
</pre>
<h2><a name="aaa"></a>How it works</h2>
<pre>
  The TCP/IP kernel is also called "stack" or "protocol stack", because
  it consists of two layers: IP and TCP. IP runs on top of the hardware
  driver and TCP on top of IP, providing an interface to <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>
  applications. For DOS different types of TCP/IP kernels are available.
    (Picture of TCP/IP kernel)
  As we see in the figure above, they can either work as external
  programs or they are already built into the applications.
    * An external TCP/IP kernel is typically started by <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT</a> or
      by a batch-file. It stays memory resident, so it can answer ping
      requests for instance.
    * Other <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> applications come with TCP/IP kernel functions
      already built-in and do not need an external TSR kernel. An
      application with built-in TCP kernel has the advantage that it
      doesn't need another driver which consumes precious DOS memory.
      On the other hand <a href="../network/tcpip.htm">TCP/IP</a> functions are limited to those of the
      <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a> application and are only provided as long as it runs. 
</pre>
<h2><a name="bbb"></a>Configuration needed</h2>
<pre>
  Every TCP/IP kernel must be configured with general information about
  the <a href="../network/network.htm">network</a>, as IP address, netmask, nameservers and gateway, or it
  must be told to get this information via a BOOTP or DHCP server.
</pre>
<h2><a name="ccc"></a>Examples</h2>
<pre>
  Examples for external TCP/IP kernels for DOS are
    * the free Trumpet TCP kernel <a href="../network/ntcpdrv.htm">NTCPDRV</a>.EXE,
    * the TCP/IP kernel of <a href="../network/novell.htm">Novell</a> NetWare TCPIP.EXE,
    * Microsoft <a href="../network/msclient.htm">MS client's</a> TCPTSR.EXE and
    * FTP Software Inc.'s ETHDRV.EXE. 
  Examples for TCP/IP kernels built into DOS applications are
    * <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a>, which is f.i. already built-in the graphical web browser
      "<a href="../network/tcpip_ap.htm#ccc">Arachne</a>",
    * the <a href="../network/mtcp.htm">mTCP</a> kernel, written in 2009,
    * the <a href="../network/history.htm#bbf">KA9Q</a> kernel which is part of that program,
    * the NCSA <a href="../network/history.htm#bbg">Telnet</a> kernel which is built into the applications
      included in this suite,
    * the <a href="../network/history.htm#bbh">CUTCP</a> kernel and
    * the University of Minnesota stack, which is part of "<a href="../network/history.htm#bbi">MINUET</a>". 
  <b>More than half of the DOS networking applications available use the
  <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a> kernel</b> says Jeffrey L. Hayes from the retrocomputing website
  <b>http://www.oldskool.org (*01)</b> (see: <b>ftp://ftp.oldskool.org/pub/tvdog/
  internet/readme.txt (*02)</b>).
  So most of us will not have to install a TCP/IP kernel at all. Instead
  we only have to care about the WATTCP.CFG configuration file for those
  networking applications.
  The next chapter takes a closer look at <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">WatTCP</a> and its successor
  <a href="../network/wattcp.htm">Watt-32</a>. Then we will examine <a href="../network/ntcpdrv.htm">NTCPDRV</a> which is the only free external
  TCP/IP kernel available. Afterwards we briefly look at other external
  TCP/IP kernels.
