<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  Variant 1 displays the current time, then enters a loop prompting
  the user to enter a new time. The loops terminates when a valid
  time had entered or the user just pressed the ENTER key to acceppt
  the current setting without changing it.
  Variant 2 displays the current system time only.
  Variant 3 does not display the current time, but tries to change the
  current time to the specified time, on failure the loop as explained
  above is entered.
  The individual portions of a time may be sperated by at least:
  dots ., colons : and forward slashes /. Other nationally used
  characters may be supported, too. If a certain number of portions
  are specified:
    error,
    hour:minute; seconds and hundreds default to zero,
    hour:minute:seconds; hundreds defaults to zero,
    hour:minute:seconds.hundreds;
    more than 4 portions result in an error.
  Separated by no, one or more whitespaces the am/pm modifiers may
  follow optionally. If present they alter the given time as follows:
    AM: if hour is equal to 12, it becomes 0 (midnight).
    PM: if hour is greater than 12, it is incremented by 12.
  TIME is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
