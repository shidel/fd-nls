<h1>Command: cd / chdir</h1>
<pre>
  Displays the name of a drive or changes the current directory. CD is
  100&percnt; compatible with the <a href="../command/cd.htm">CHDIR</a> command; there is no difference --
  beside the spelling -- between them.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  1. CD
  2. CD [ drive ':' ] path
  3. CD '-'
  4. CD [..] [-] [\] [/?]
    drive  The drive letter, e.g. C:
    path   The directory, e.g. \example\
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  ..  Specifies that you want to change to the parent directory.
  -   If "last directory" feature is enabled, change to last directory.
  \   Changes to root (C:\ or D:\ etc.)
  /?  Shows the help.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  The first variant shows the current working directory as absolute path.
  The second variant changes the current directory of the given drive. If
  no drive is specified on command line, the current directory of the
  currently selected drive (disk) is changed. This command does not
  change the currently selected drive in opposite to CDD!
  The third variant changes back into the last visited directory and
  drive. The commands CD, CHDIR, CDD, and PUSHD save the current working
  directory before performing the specified directory change; the command
  CD '-' restores this saved directory. This command is available only,
  if the feature LAST_DIR has been enabled during the compilation of
  FreeCOM.
  CD ".." moves back folder by folder, whereas CD "\" jumps back to root
  with one command.
  CD / CHIR is stored in the context segment (last directory) of of
  command.com, for more information see: <a href="../base/command.htm">COMMAND /E:nnn</a> and <a href="../command/memory.htm">MEMORY</a>.

  CD / CHDIR is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Example 1:
    CD \FREEDOS\HELP
  Changes the current working directory of the currently selected drive
  to the path \FREEDOS\HELP.
  Example 2:
    CD C:\FREEDOS\HELP
  Changes the current directory of drive C:.
  Example 3:
  Assuming the current working directory is \FREEDOS\HELP and the
  currently selected drive is C:.
    CD displays C:\FREEDOS\HELP
  Example 4:
  The command sequence, provided the first two worked successfully:
    CD \FREEDOS\HELP
    CD ..
    CD -
  changes first into the directory \FREEDOS\HELP, then into its parent
  directory, which is \FREECOM. And finally CD - changes back to
  \FREEDOS\HELP, because this was the previous directory before previous
  CD-like command.
  Because CD - saves the previous directory, too, any subsequent: CD -
  will switch between these two directories; until another directory is
  changed to.
  Example 5:
    CD shows C:\FREEDOS\HELP
    CD HTMLHELP                  OR:
    CD C:\FREEDOS\HELP\HTMLHELP  changes to this subdirectory.
    CD ..                        changes to C:\FREEDOS\HELP you can run
                                 back by using CD .. several times OR:
    CD \                         changes back to root (C:\) directly.
