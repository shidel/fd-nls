<h1>Command: date</h1>
<pre>
  Displays or sets current date.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  1. DATE
  2. DATE [ /D ]
  3. DATE [ /D ] date
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  All options must precede any arguments.
  none     You are prompted for a new date for your system.
           Values for the day (dd), month (mm), and year (yy or yyyy)
           may be seperated by periods, hyphens, or slashes. Either
           a 4-digit or 2-digit year may be used.
           So you can choose between:
           mm-dd-yy or mm-dd-yyyy e.g. date 04-22-07 or 04-22-2007
           mm/dd/yy or mm/dd/yyyy e.g. date 04/22/07 or 04/22/2007
           mm.dd.yy or mm.dd.yyyy e.g. date 04.22.07 or 04.22.2007
  /D       Prevents from prompting the user. The date is displayed only.
  /D date  The date is tried to be changed, but the loop is not entered
           on failure.
  /?       Shows the help.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  The first variant displays the current system date, then enters a
  loop prompting the user for a new date. The loop terminates, if the
  user entered a valid new date or just pressed the ENTER key to
  accept the current setting without changing it.
  The second variant displays the current system date only.
  The third variant does not display the current date and tries to
  change the date to the specified date. On success the command
  terminates, otherwise enters the loop explained above.
  The individual portions of a date may be separated by at least:
  dots ., forward slashes / or dashes -. Other nationally used
  characters may be supported, too.
  DATE will support partial formats:
    A single number: specifies the day only.
    Two numbers: specifies the day and the month in the order used by
    the national date format, which is MM/DD for American and Japanese
    and DD/MM for European format.
    Three numbers: specifies a full date including day, month and year
    in the order suitable for the national date format, which is:
        MM/DD/[CC]YY: for American,
        DD/MM/[CC]YY: for European and
        [CC]YY/MM/DD: for Japanese format.
  If the year portion is less than 100, the century is assumed to
  be 1900, if it is greater or equal than 80; otherwise the century
  is 2000.
  Note: Some European countries introduced the so-called business date
  in 1996 or so, which is the same as the Japanese format; it makes
  sorting of literal dates a lot easier. If FreeCOM will or will not
  support it, this will depend on the NLS used by DOS.
  Symbolical names of monthes are not support (yet).
  DATE is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
