  WHICH is a utility born in the UNIX world that enables users to find
  executable files in directories listed in the PATH ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLE. See <a href="../batch/set.htm">SET</a> / <a href="../command/environm.htm">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE</a>.
  WHICH searches for the specified command(s) the same way as if it
  would be specified on command line as command itself. If an executable
  file is found, its path is displayed in this format:
    command "tab" path

  in order to work.
