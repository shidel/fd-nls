<h1>Command: pushd</h1>
<pre>
  PUSHD pushes current directory onto the directory stack,
  with the option to change current working directory.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  PUSHD [[drive]path] [/?]
        [[drive]path] is a path to which you wish to change.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /?  Shows the help.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  PUSHD is a lot like CD, except that it stores the current directory
  before changing it. Later on, <a href="../command/popd.htm">POPD</a> can be used to restore it.
  PUSHD can be used several times, storing a stack of directories.
  Using PUSHD without specifying a directory will store the current
  directory, but not change it.
  PUSHD is stored in the context segment (directory stack) of of
  command.com, for more information see: <a href="../base/command.htm">COMMAND /E:nnn</a> and <a href="../command/memory.htm">MEMORY</a>.
  PUSHD is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  this command            changes the current directory to / shows:
  ============            =========================================
  cd c:\FREEDOS\BIN       c:\FREEDOS\BIN
  pushd c:\GAMES          c:\GAMES        (and stores c:\FREEDOS\BIN)
  pushd c:\UTILS          c:\UTILS        (and stores c:\GAMES)
  pushd c:\packages       c:\packages     (and stores c:\UTILS)
  dirs                    shows the directories stored by pushd:
                            0001=c:\FREEDOS\BIN
                            0002=c:\GAMES
                            0003=c:\UTILS
  popd                    c:\UTILS        (and removes c:\UTILS (0003)
                                          from directory stack)
  popd                    c:\GAMES        (and removes c:\GAMES (0002)
                                          from directory stack)
  popd                    c:\FREEDOS\BIN  (and removes c:\FREEDOS\BIN
                                          (0001) from directory stack)
  popd                    shows the message: "Directory stack empty"
