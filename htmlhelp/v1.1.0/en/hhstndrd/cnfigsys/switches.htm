<h1>Command: switches</h1>
<pre>
  SWITCHES adjusts boot time processing behaviour.
  SWITCHES is a <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS / FDCONFIG.SYS</a> command.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  switches=/E[:xxx] /F /K /N /W
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /E   Specifies how to handle moving of EBDA (Extended BIOS Data Area),
       if a size in bytes is specified [xxx, in range of 48-1024]
       then the EBDA will be moved from the top of conventional memory
       to a lower address (allowing for potentially larger free block
       of conventional memory if video memory at A0000 is available).
       Without a size, the EBDA will not be moved.
  /F   Skips the delay checking for F5/F8 keystroke before processing
       CONFIG.SYS [equivalent to SYS CONFIG skipconfigseconds=0]
       F5 and F8 are only processed if pressed before DOS boots but
       after the keyboard is set up - right moment is easy to miss.
  /K   Forces treating of keyboard as 86 key keyboard, not 102/105 key.
       Might be useful with BIOSes or drivers which have no or broken
       handling for 102/105 key keyboards.
  /N   Disables F5/F8 support [equivalent to kernel config (SYS CONFIG,
       run SYS CONFIG /? for explanations) skipconfigseconds=-1]
       F5 (skip config) and F8 (single step config.sys) key presses
       are ignored (note: with /F a well-timed F5/F8 still works, whereas
       /N completely disables).
  /W   Is NOT supported in FreeDOS. This option in MS DOS would set a
       flag for Windows 3.0 to skip loading wina20.386 from the root
       directory, used when \WINA20.386 is moved into a subdirectory, a
       device line with proper path must be added to Microsoft (R)
       Windows SYSTEM.INI [386Enhanced] section. --- May be ignored
       for compatibility
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  SWITCHES is a command internal to kernel.sys and needs no other file
  in order to work.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  IN CONFIG.SYS / FDCONFIG.SYS:
    switches=/E[:48] /F /K /N /W
</pre>
