<h1>Command: ps2mtest</h1>
<pre>
  <a href="../util/usbdos.htm">USBDOS</a> is a collection of different USB drivers and tools:
  PS2MTEST will simply display the "raw" data as it comes from the
  PS2 Mouse BIOS.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  PS2MTEST &num;
    where &num; is either 0, 1, or 2, and is the maximum number of
    wheels that you want this program to look for.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  0 = Enable the Mouse as a "Regular" Mouse (No Wheels, Max 3 Buttons),
      even if the Mouse has Wheel(s).
  1 = Enable the IntelliMouse Protocol (Max 1 Wheel, 3 Buttons),
      if the Mouse is capable. Do not enable the IntelliMouse2
      Protocol, even if the Mouse supports it.
  2 = Enable the IntelliMouse2 Protocol (Max 2 Wheels, 5 Buttons),
      if the Mouse is capable.  If the IntelliMouse2 Protocol is
      not supported, enable the IntelliMouse Protocol.  If neither
      IntelliMouse Protocol is supported, enable the Mouse as a
      "Regular" Mouse.  This is the Default.
  This program will simply display the "raw" data as it comes from the
  PS2 Mouse BIOS. It is designed as a testing program, so may not be
  very useful if you're not writing a program related to the PS2 Mouse.
  Then again, you may find it interesting to see what the Mouse BIOS
  is actually doing behind the scenes.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  PS2MTEST is a program designed to test your PS2 mouse. It does this by
  displaying the "raw" data that is coming from the mouse through the PS2
  mouse BIOS (software). It's included here as a "companion" program to
  help you test USBMOUSE (discussed directly on page 107 of
  USBINTRO.DOC, see links below), but you can also use it to simply
  test your PS2 mouse.
  What you will see on the screen when you run PS2MTEST will be four
  words (eight bytes) of data on the left, labeled "Raw PS2 Mouse Data".
  The PS2 Mouse BIOS always transfers eight bytes of data, even though
  only three or four of the bytes actually contain any useful data. This
  is  where the raw data (numbers) will be displayed as you move the
  mouse and press the buttons.
  To the right of the raw data on the screen are three columns, labeled
  "Buttons", "Motion", and "Wheels". This is where the raw data is
  translated into meaningful descriptions (button presses, mouse
  movements, and scrolling wheel clicks). Exactly how the data gets
  translated depends on which protocol is currently being used by the
  mouse (PS2, IntelliMouse, or IntelliMouse2, described on page
  110 of USBINTRO.DOC, see links below). Only three bytes of actual data
  are transferred when the mouse is in PS2 mode, and four bytes are
  transferred when the mouse is in IntelliMouse or IntelliMouse2 mode.
  Exactly which bits of data correspond to which buttons and movements
  changes based on the protocol currently in use, and those details will
  not be discussed here.
  Information about that is available at various places on the internet
  if you want to search for it.
  By default, PS2MTEST will use the most sophisticated protocol supported
  by the mouse hardware and BIOS (IntelliMouse2 is the first choice,
  followed by IntelliMouse, with PS2 as the last choice). If you are
  using USBMOUSE in BIOS (software) emulation mode, it will always
  support the IntelliMouse2 protocol. If you are not using USBMOUSE at
  all, or are using USBMOUSE in hardware emulation mode, the most
  sophisticated protocol supported will depend on the PS2 mouse hardware
  (how many wheels and buttons it has).
  Although the default is for PS2MTEST to use the most sophisticated
  protocol, you can force it to use a less sophisticated protocol if you
  want to for testing or educational purposes. To do this, you must
  provide to PS2MTEST a number which corresponds to the maximum number of
  wheels supported by the protocol (0 = PS2, 1 = IntelliMouse, and 2 =
  IntelliMouse2). For example, to provide the same functionality as the
  default, you would do the following:
    PS2MTEST 2
  This will test the mouse using the IntelliMouse2 protocol (maximum of 2
  wheels and 5 buttons) if the mouse supports it. If the mouse does not
  support the IntelliMouse2 protocol, but does support the IntelliMouse
  protocol, this will test the mouse using the IntelliMouse protocol. If
  the mouse only supports the PS2 protocol, this will test in using the
  PS2 protocol.
  To test the mouse using the IntelliMouse protocol, even if it supports
  the IntelliMouse2 protocol, you would do the following:
    PS2MTEST 1
  If the mouse does not support the IntelliMouse protocol, PS2MTEST will
  test the mouse with the PS2 protocol.
  To force PS2MTEST to test the mouse with the PS2 protocol, no matter
  how many wheels it actually has, you would do the following:
    PS2MTEST 0
  After you are through viewing the raw PS2 mouse data, simply press a
  key on the keyboard and PS2MTEST will stop. After PS2MTEST stops, it
  will attempt to restore the PS2 mouse BIOS and DOS Mouse Driver to the
  same exact state it was in before you ran PS2MTEST. While the
  restoration process usually works just fine, there are times when it
  does not. If the restoration process does not seem to work correctly,
  you will need to reset or reinstall the DOS Mouse Driver again.
