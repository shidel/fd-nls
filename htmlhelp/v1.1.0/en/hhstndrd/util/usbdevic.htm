<h1>Command: usbdevic</h1>
<pre>
  <a href="../util/usbdos.htm">USBDOS</a> is a collection of different USB drivers and tools:
  USBDEVIC is a Program to display information about Devices attached
  to the USB Host(s).
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  USBDEVIC [Options]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  ?    Show this HELP screen
  A    Show all ALIASES for these command line Options
  V    Show all ErrorLevels (DOS Return Codes)
  &num;    Show all devices attached to USB Host Index &num; (0-15)
  N    Show New Device Notification Table for USB Hosts
  You can combine more than one &num; (Host Index) and N (New Device
  Table) on the same command-line. The following, for example, is OK:
    USBDEVIC 0 1 12 N
  If running from inside another program (if not running from the command-
  line), the Options can be followed with a hex call-back address
  (Segment:Offset) to which the output will be written.
  USBDEVIC with no Options after it will display details about the USB
  Devices attached to all compatible USB Hosts.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  USBDEVIC shows details about all of the different Device/Interfaces
  that are attached to the USB busses. The details include the assigned
  Address, the Device/Interface "type" or "class", power requirements,
  manufacturer, which port of which Hub the Physical Device is plugged
  into, etc.
  If you run USBDEVIC with no option switches, it will show you the
  details of ALL Device/Interfaces that are attached to ALL busses:
    USBDEVIC
  You can also have USBDEVIC show you all Device/Interfaces that are
  attached to a single bus. To do this, you must provide USBDEVIC the
  Host Index number (0-15) of the Host Controller you are wanting to view.
  For example, to view the details of all Device/'Interfaces attached to
  Host Index 2:
    USBDEVIC 2
  Note that what must be provided is the Host Index number, and NOT the
  PCI Search Index number. The Host Index number is associated with the
  Host Controller Driver (USBUHCI{L}) and the Application Programming
  Interface (API), not with the PCI bus hardware.
  You can also have USBDEVIC show you the Device/Interface details for
  more than one bus at a time, but not necessarily all of them. To do
  this, you just provide more than one Host Index number. The show the
  Device/Interface details for Host Index 2 followed by Host Index 1,
  for example, you would do:
    USBDEVIC 2 1
  Most of the Device/Interface details shown by USBDEVIC are fairly self-
  explanatory, at least if you're familiar with the USB architecture.
  Some of them need further explanation, however. The explanations are
  provided under "Attached Devices" (page 73 of USBINTRO.DOC, see links
  below), and will not be repeated here.
  In addition to showing you details about the Device/Interfaces attached
  to the bus, USBDEVICE will also show you the contents of the New Device
  Notification table. The concept of New Device Notifications is a
  complicated aspect of the Application Programming Interface (API), which
  is described in detail in a separate document called USBAPI.DOC. There
  is also a brief description given in the "New Device Notifications"
  section (page 74 of USBINTRO.DOC, see links below). Those details will
  not be repeated here.
  To display the contents of the New Device Notification table (stored in
  memory as along with the first instance of USBUHCI{L}), you would do
  the following:
    USBDEVIC NewDeviceTable
  In order to write the company name of the Device/Interface manufacturer,
  USBDEVIC calls the support program VENDORID (page 184 of USBINTRO.DOC,
  see links below). In order to write a description of the "type" of
  Device/Interface, USBDEVIC calls the support program USBSUPT1 (page 178
  of USBINTRO.DOC, see links below).
