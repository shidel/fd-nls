<h1>Command: zip</h1>
<pre>
  ZIP is a compression and file packaging utility, like PKZIP.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  zip [-options] [-b path] [-t mmddyyyy] [-n suffixes] [zipfile list]
       [xi list]
  The default action is to add or replace zipfile entries from list,
  which can include the special name - to compress standard input.
  If zipfile and list are omitted, zip compresses stdin to stdout.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  -f   Replace (freshen) an existing entry in the zip archive only
       if it has been modified more recently than the version already
       in the archive.
  -d   Remove (delete) entries from a zip archive. For example:
       zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\* \*.o will remove the entry
       foo/tom/junk, all of the files that start with foo/harry/, and
       all of the files that end with .o (in any path).
  -r   Travel the directory structure recursively.
  -0   Indicates no compression (store all files).
  -1   Indicates the fastest compression method (less compression).
  -q   Quiet mode; eliminate informational messages and comment prompts.
       (Useful, for example, in shell scripts and background tasks).
  -c   Add one-line comments for each file.
  -@   Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one file-
       name per line.
  -x files  Explicitly exclude the specified files.
  -F   Fix the zip archive. (-FF try harder)
  -A   Adjust self-extracting executable archive.
  -T   Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails, the
       old zip file is unchanged and (with the -m option) no input
       files are removed.
  -$   Include the volume label for the drive holding the first file to
       be compressed.
  -e   Encrypt the contents of the zip archive using a password which
       is entered on the terminal in response to a prompt (this will
       not be echoed; if standard error is not a tty, zip will exit
       with an error). The password prompt is repeated to save the
       user from typing errors. Note that this encrypts with standard
       pkzip encryption which is considered weak.
  -h   Display the zip help information (this also appears if zip is
       run with no arguments).
  -h2  Show more help.
  -u   Replace (update) an existing entry in the zip archive only if it
       has been modified more recently than the version already in the
       zip archive.
  -m   Move the specified files into the zip archive; actually,
       this deletes the target directories/files after making the
       specified zip archive.
  -j   Store just the name of a saved file (junk the path), and do
       not store directory names. By default, zip will store the full
       path
  -l   Translate the Unix end-of-line character LF into the MSDOS con-
       vention CR LF (-ll CR LF to LF)
  -9   Indicates the slowest compression method (optimal compression,
       ignores the suffix list). The default compression level is -6.
  -v   Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.
  -z   Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire zip archive.
  -o   Set the "last modified" time of the zip archive to the latest
       (oldest) "last modified" time found among the entries in the
       zip archive.
  -i files      Include only the specified files, as in: zip -r foo .
                -i \*.c which will include only the files that end in
                .c in the current directory and its subdirectories.
                -F  fix zipfile (-FF try harder)
                -D  do not add directory entries
                -A  adjust self-extracting exe
  -D   Do not create entries in the zip archive for directories.
  -J   Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the archive.
  -X   Do not save extra file attributes.
  -S   Include system and hidden files.
  -n suffixes   Do not attempt to compress files named with the given
                suffixes.
  -L   Display the zip software license.
  -g   Grow (append to) the specified zip archive, instead of creating
       a new one.
  -k   Attempt to convert the names and paths to conform to MSDOS,
       store only the MSDOS attribute (just the user write attribute
       from UNIX), and mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though
       it was not); for compatibility with PKUNZIP under MSDOS which
       cannot handle certain names such as those with two dots.
  -MM  All input patterns must match at least one file and all input
       files found must be readable.
  -R   Travel the directory structure recursively starting at the
       current directory.
  -b path       Use the specified path for the temporary zip archive. For
                example: zip -b /tmp stuff * will put the temporary zip
                archive in the directory /tmp, copying over stuff.zip to
                the current directory when done.
  -P password   Use password to encrypt zipfile entries (if any). THIS
                IS INSECURE!
  -t mmddyyyy   Do not operate on files modified prior to the specified
                date, where mm is the month (0-12), dd is the day of the
                month (1-31), and yyyy is the year. The ISO 8601 date
                format yyyy-mm-dd is
                also accepted.
  -tt mmddyyyy  Do not operate on files modified after or at the speci-
                fied date, where mm is the month (0-12), dd is the day
                of the month (1-31), and yyyy is the year. The ISO 8601
                date format yyyy-mm-dd is also accepted.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  The simplest example:
    zip stuff *
  creates the archive stuff.zip (assuming it does not exist) and puts
  all the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form.
