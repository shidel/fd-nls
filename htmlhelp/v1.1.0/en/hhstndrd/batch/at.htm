<h1>Command: @ (at)</h1>
<pre>
  The at-sign @ disables the echo status right for this line in
  a <a href="../batch/index.htm">BATCH FILE</a> or in <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT / FDAUTO.BAT</a>.
  If you enter a command in command line the command will be executed
  immediately. When executing a command from a batch file without at-sign
  @ it is first given from batch to command line, shown there, and then
  executed. @ avoids this.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  @command
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  - none -
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  @command: Instead of ECHO ON / OFF you can place an @ character in
  front of each BATCH command you do not want to show.
  @ECHO OFF: Disables the echo status in the batch file. Because the
  at-sign @ disables the echo status right for this line, this command
  disables echoing all the next lines of a batch script and is not
  echoed to the console itself. It is, therefore, best placed in the
  first line of a batch script.
  @ECHO ON: Enables the echo status. Because the at-sign @ disables
  the echo status right for this line, this command enables echoing all
  the next lines of a batch script and is not echoed to the console
  itself.
  @ is no existing command but part of the commands in a <a href="../batch/index.htm">batch file</a>:
  As it is often in use there is an own "command" here to show
  where and how it can be used.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  IN A BATCH FILE:
  Example 1:
    chkdsk c:
    pause       (repeats the chkdsk c: command and then executes it)
  Example 2:
    @chkdsk c:  (same as Example 1 but the chkdsk c: command is not
                repeated, only executed)
    pause
  Example 3:
    @echo on    (repeats ALL commands except "echo on" before execution)
    chkdsk c:
    pause
    dir c:
    pause
  Example 4:
    @echo off   (repeats none of the commands before execution)
    chkdsk c:
    pause
    dir c:
    pause
  @ECHO OFF  Disables the ECHO status. Because the at-sign @ disables the
  ECHO status right for this line, this command disables echoing all the
  next lines of a batch script and is not echoed to the console itself.
  It is, therefore, best placed in the first line of a batch script.
