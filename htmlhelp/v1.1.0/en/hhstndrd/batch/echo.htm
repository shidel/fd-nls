<h1>Command: echo (command.com command)</h1>
<pre>
  ECHO displays messages, or turns command-echoing on or off.
  There also exists a <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS / FDCONFIG.SYS</a> <a href="../cnfigsys/echo.htm">ECHO</a> command.
  ECHO is a <a href="../batch/index.htm">BATCH-FILE</a> / <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT / FDAUTO.BAT</a> command.
  It can also be used in command line (except with @ - at symbol).
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  1. ECHO [ON | OFF]
  2. ECHO [message (string)]
  3. ECHO.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  ON       ECHO mode is activated. If you use ECHO within a batch
           file, each command line is shown when it is executed.
  OFF      ECHO mode is deactivated. If you use ECHO within a batch
           file, the command line is not shown when it is executed.
           This does not affect the output of the command itself.
  message  The message you want to print on the screen.
  .        Displays an empty line.
  /?       Shows the help.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  When executing a <a href="../batch/index.htm">BATCH</a> script each line is displayed to the console
  before executing it by default. The first variant of ECHO enables or
  disables this behaviour. To disable echoing the command is equal to
  prefix each line of a batch script with the at-symbol @.
  If ECHO is invoked with no argument at all, the current echo status
  is displayed.
  When entered on an interactive command line the echo status controls
  whether or not the PROMPT string is displayed.
  The second variant displays the specified "string". Note:
  Because of variant 1 "string" may not expand to the single words ON
  or OFF without another character.
  The third variant displays an empty line. No space must be placed
  between the dot and ECHO.
  ECHO can be used to create text files, e.g. BATCH files. In this case
  you have to send the text to a file via "&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;" if you
  want to add several lines. See example below. &percnt; characters have
  to be added twice.
  ECHO is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work. There also exists a <a href="../cnfigsys/index.htm">CONFIG.SYS / FDCONFIG.SYS</a>
  <a href="../cnfigsys/echo.htm">ECHO</a> command with different options.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Example 1 (in command line and BATCH):
    ECHO
  Displays the current echo status, e.g. responding:
    ECHO is on
  Example 2 (only in a BATCH file):
    @ECHO OFF
  Disables the echo status. Because the at-sign @ disables the echo
  status right for this line, this command disable echoing all the next
  lines of a batch script and is not echoed to the console itself. It
  is, therefore, best placed in the first line of a batch script.
  Example 3 (in command line and BATCH):
    ECHO Just a text
  Displays Just a text
  Example 4:
  IN A BATCH FILE / AUTOEXEC.BAT:
    ECHO Hi,
    ECHO. how are you?
    @ECHO Fine?
    @ECHO. Nice to hear this
  Example 5:
  You want to create a text file with ECHO:
    ECHO How are you? &gt; C:\DOCUMENT\areyouok.txt
    ECHO Yes, I am fine &gt;&gt; C:\DOCUMENT\areyouok.txt
    ECHO At least for 50 &percnt;&percnt; &gt;&gt; C:\areyouok.txt
