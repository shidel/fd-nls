<h1>Command: for</h1>
<pre>
  FOR runs a specified command for each file in a set of files.
  FOR is a COMMAND LINE and a <a href="../batch/index.htm">BATCH-FILE</a> / <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT /FDAUTO.BAT</a>
  command.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  FOR &percnt;variable IN (set) DO command [cmd-parameters] OR:
  FOR &percnt;&percnt;variable IN (set) DO command [cmd-paramters]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  &percnt;variable       A name for the parameter that will be replaced
                  with each file name. The variable may only be one
                  character long.
  &percnt;&percnt;variable      A name for the parameter that will be replaced
                  with each file name. The variable may only be one
                  character long.
  (set)           Specifies a set of one or more files. Wildcards
                  and ? may be used.
  command         Specifies the command to run for each file.
  cmd-parameters  Specifies parameters or switches for the
                  specified command.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  The FOR command does NOT distinguish if ONE or more percent characters
  are used in COMMAND LINE or in BATCH FILES (tested). The variables are
  case sensitive and maybe only ONE character long.
  FOR is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  IN COMMAND LINE:
    Example 1:
    Displays all the text files in the current directory, one after
    another:
      FOR &percnt;f in (*.txt) DO more &percnt;f

    Example 2:
    The following two commands list all files starting with an "a". The
    list starts with "---start---" and ends with "---end---". The "-"
    sign at the beginning and at the end of each line comes from "DO
    ECHO - &percnt;f -".
      ECHO off
      FOR &percnt;f IN (---start--- a*.* ---end---) DO ECHO - &percnt;f -
      ECHO on

    Example 3:
    The following command writes a list of all files in the directory
    into a .txt file. You need a ">>", otherwise the first written text
    is overwritten by the following text:
      ECHO off
      for &percnt;g in (*.*) do echo &percnt;i &gt;&gt; echo.txt
      ECHO on

    Example 4:
    The following command creates folder01 till folder10.
      for &percnt;i in (01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,10) DO MD folder&percnt;i
    You can also use a space instead of a comma, e.g.:
    for &percnt;j in (01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10) DO RD folder&percnt;j

    Example 5:
    The following command deletes all files ending with "tmp" or starting
    with "temp" in a batch file:
      for &percnt;&percnt;b in (*.tmp temp????.*) do del &percnt;&percnt;b
    Please keep in mind that variables are case sensitive, means:
    do not mix &percnt;b with &percnt;B.
