<h1>Command: call</h1>
<pre>
  CALL calls a nested batchfile or a program.
  CALL is a <a href="../batch/index.htm">BATCH-FILE</a> / <a href="../batch/autoexec.htm">AUTOEXEC.BAT / FDAUTO.BAT</a> command.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  CALL [/Y] program [arguments]
  CALL [/Y] [/S|/N] [drive][path] program [arguments]
       drive      The drive letter, e.g. C:
       path       The directory, e.g. \example\
       program    The batchfile or program to be called.
       arguments: Specifies any command-line information required by the
                  program or batch file.
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /S: If program is not a batch script, the external program is executed
      by swapping FreeCOM out of memory. This process will require more
      time, especially if FreeCOM is to be reloaded from a floppy, some
      internal settings are lost, e.g. command line history, but it will
      free as much memory as possible for the external program.
      This option and, thereby, this function is available only, if
      FreeCOM had been compiled with some support for swapping.
  /N: If program is not a batch script, the external program is executed
      directly, with swapping disabled. /N supersedes /S.
  /Y: Enables tracemode during execution of the command.
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  If the program is a batch script, that means it has the extension .BAT,
  CALL nests the batch script within the already running one, means:
  The processing of the original batch file resumes. Without CALL the
  invoked batch script would terminate all already running batch
  scripts. If present, the arguments are passed unchanged to the invoked
  program.
  CALL is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.
</pre>
<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  IN A .BAT FILE / AUTOEXEC.BAT:
    first command
    second command
    call c:\xy.bat OR: call C:\FREEDOS\BIN\defrag c:
    third command
    fourth command (first and second command are executed, then xy.bat OR
                    defrag c: till it is finished, then FreeDOS continues
                    with third and fourth command. Without call third and
                    fourth command would not be executed).
