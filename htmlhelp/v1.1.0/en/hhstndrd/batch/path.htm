<h1>Command: path</h1>
<pre>
  Display or set the search path for executable files.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
   1. PATH
   2. PATH [ '=' ] { path : ';' }
   3. PATH;
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  PATH  Displays the currently active search path.
  PATH= Assigns the specified paths to the search path.
        The leading equal sign, if present is ignored.
  PATH; Empties the search path.
  /?    Shows the help
</pre>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  Displays or assigns a new search path.
  When FreeCOM searches for an external command or a batch script,
  which has no path specified, it is search for in all the directories
  specified in the search path. If the current directory . is not
  mentioned in the search path, it is searched through first.
  The paths of any frequently used programs can be put on the path list
  for convenience.
  When a program or external command is entered at the command prompt,
  FreeDOS looks for it in the current directory and then in each of the
  paths specified by the path command.
  If the same program name is in different path directories, the program
  will be started from the path which is first mentioned in the
  pathlist.
  PATH can also be used outside a batch file.
  PATH is a command internal to command.com and needs no other file
  in order to work.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  Example 1:
  path C:\FREEDOS\BIN;C:\TOOLS;D:\OTHERS\BIN;BIN
  If FreeCOM is to execute an external program, e.g. XCOPY, FreeCOM
  will search for the program in the following directories in the
  specified order, the first program file found is executed:

    the current directory
    C:\FREEDOS\BIN
    C:\TOOLS
    D:\OTHERS\BIN
    BIN
  Note: Because the last directory specification is a relative one,
  rather than an absolute one, the program is searched for in the
  sub-directory BIN of the current directory.

  Example 2:
  IN A .BAT FILE / AUTOEXEC.BAT:
    path C:\FREEDOS\BIN;C:\UTIL
    path &percnt;path&percnt;;C:\GAMES
    This example adds C:\GAMES to the existing list, preserving the
    previously set paths. When you type path now the result is:
    path C:\FREEDOS\BIN;C:\UTIL;C:\GAMES
