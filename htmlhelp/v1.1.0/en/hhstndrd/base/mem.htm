<pre>
  MEM displays the amount of installed and free memory in your system.
</pre>
<h2>Syntax:</h2>
<pre>
  MEM [options] [/?]
</pre>
<h2>Options:</h2>
<pre>
  /ALL        Show all details of high memory area (HMA).
  /C          Classify modules using memory below 1 MB.
  /D          Same as /DEBUG by default, same as /DEVICE if /OLD used.
  /DEBUG      Show programs and devices in conventional and upper memory.
  /DEVICE     List of device drivers currently in memory.
  /E          Reports all information about Expanded Memory.
  /F          Same as /FREE by default, same as /FULL if /OLD used.
  /FREE       Show free conventional and upper memory blocks.
  /FULL       Full list of memory blocks.
  /M (name) | /MODULE (name)
              Show memory used by the given program or driver.
  /NOSUMMARY  Do not show the summary normally displayed when no other
              options are specified.
  /OLD        Compatability with FreeDOS MEM 1.7 beta.
  /P          Pauses after each screenful of information.
  /SUMMARY    Negates the /NOSUMMARY option.
  /U          List of programs in conventional and upper memory.

<h2>Comments:</h2>

  Displaying memory status:  FreeDOS displays extended memory only if
  you have memory installed above the 1MB boundary. FreeDOS displays
  expanded memory only if it conforms to version 4.0 of the Lotus/Intel/
  Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification (LIM EMS).
  Allocating extended memory: To allocate both Interrupt 15h memory and
  XMS memory, use the int15 switch when you load FD(X)XMS.SYS, HIMEM.EXE
  or HIMEM.SYS (outdated in FreeDOS).

  Different types of memory:
  Total conventional memory is the amount of memory on your computer up
  to the first 640K. Free Conventional Memory is the amount of con-
  ventional memory FreeDOS has for operating your computer, including
  the memory it needs for itself.
  Total EMS memory is the amount of expanded memory on your computer.
  Free EMS memory is the amount of expanded memory available to programs.
  If you use EMM386 to simulate expanded memory, that memory appears in
  these two values.
  Available XMS memory is memory managed by an extended-memory manager
  such as HIMEM.SYS, and available to programs that can use it.

  This command is interesting if you have problems with crashing
  programs. With the command you can see if there is enough memory
  to execute the program. If the lower memory is too small it may help
  to load the program into high memory with the <a href="../batch/lh.htm">LH /LOADHIGH</a> command.
  MEM supports NLS (national language support).
