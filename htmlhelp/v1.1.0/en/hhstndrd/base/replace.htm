<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  REPLACE has the following <a href="../batch/errorlvl.htm">ERRORLEVEL / EXITCODES</a>:
    0   No error. REPLACE successfully replaced or added the files.
    1   Function number invalid. The computer has a version of DOS that
        is incompatible with REPLACE. (Not implemented at the moment!)
    2   File not found. REPLACE could not find the source files.
    3   Path not found. REPLACE could not find the source or destination
        path.

        destination files.
    8   Insufficient memory. There is insufficient system memory to
        carry out the command. (Not implemented because not possible
        to handle in a high level language like C!)
    11  Format invalid. The user used the wrong syntax on the command
        line.
    29  Write fault. REPLACE could not write the destination files.
    30  Read fault. REPLACE could not read the source files.
