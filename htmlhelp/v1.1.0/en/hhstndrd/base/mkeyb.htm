<h1>Command: mkeyb</h1>
<pre>
  MKEYB is a minimum keyboard driver for xxDOS, requiring
  only ~500 bytes of memory to support international keyboards
  (Russian 452, German 474, Spanish 718 byte).

  MKEYB is also an interesting demonstration of
  'The Art of writing small TSR's in High Level Language'
  FreeDOS has three keyboard drivers: <a href="../base/keyb.htm">KEYB</a>, MKEYB and <a href="../base/xkeyb.htm">XKEYB</a>.

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  MKEYB is based on the idea, that the keyboard is already (mostly)
  handled by the system BIOS, and that most keys are already correctly
  handled by it.
  MKEYB relies mostly on the BIOS to do what must be done, and only
  exchanges a few keys, as required by the national keyboard layout.
  MKEYB (KEYB) automatically loads itself as high as possible
  - it is therefore not necessary to use <a href="../batch/lh.htm">LH</a> / <a href="../batch/lh.htm">LOADHIGH</a>.
  COMBI tables:
  These are not needed by all languages, but some (like Spanish Catalan)
  require them. they mostly define '`^ + aeiou.
  COMBI define characters, that are generated by two sequential
  keystrokes, like '+A, `+A, ~+A, for some Swedish characters.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  mkeyb GR     loads the German keyboard driver
  mkeyb /U     unloads the keyboard driver
  mkeyb GR /T  test the German keyboard driver, don't go resident
