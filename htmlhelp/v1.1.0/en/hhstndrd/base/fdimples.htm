<h2>Comments:</h2>
<pre>
  FDIMPLES is a visual tool to browse, install and remove packages that
  are included on the FreeDOS release media. Depending on the choices
  made during the installation of FreeDOS, many packages may not be
  included during installation. Those packages and others can be installed
  later by inserting the package media (LiveCD, BonusCD, etc.) and then
  execute FDIMPLES. If the package media is not found or inserted before
  running FDIMPLES, only the packages that are already installed are
  displayed.

  Then browse the lists of packages and select any you want to install.
  Use the TAB, LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN keys to navigate. To cycle through
  the available actions for a package or group of packages use either
  the SPACE or ENTER keys. This will change the state of the selected
  package or group. The desired state is represented by different
  symbols inside the square brackets next to the group or package.
  The current group and package are displayed using green text when
  they do not have focus.

  The symbols used for group states (left panel):

  empty    No programs in group are to be installed or kept. Any
           programs in this group that were installed will be removed.
  +        Some programs in this group are (or will be) installed.
  X        All programs in this group are (or will be) installed.

  The symbols used for package states (right panel):

  empty    Package is not installed or should be removed.
  X        Package is (or will be) installed.
  U        Newer version of package is on the media. The current
           packages should be removed and the newer one installed.
  R        Older version of the package is on the media. The current
           package should be removed and the older version should
           be installed replacing the newer package. (downgrade)

  No package changes are performed until you navigate to the "OK"
  button in the lower right of the display and press SPACE or ENTER.
  Then all package installations or removals will be performed at once.

  If you are unsure of which packages will be removed or installed,
  press the "V" key to view all proposed changes that will occur.

  ESC exits the program at any time without making any changes to the
  currently installed packages. Of course you can also use the commands
  described at section "Options" - User interface commands.

  FDIMPLES gives you basic information about the programs in the lower
  part of the window. You can jump in there with TAB (text will be
  highlighted) to see which files will be installed if you want to do
  so.

  To perform installation or removal of packages, FDIMPLES requires that
  the command line utility FDINST is installed. FDINST is a simplified
  version of FDNPKG and is usually installed by default with the FDNPKG
  package.

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<pre>
  fdimples            launch and search for the package media
  fdimples X:\FDPKGS  launch and use the specified path as package media
  fdimples /update    launch, find the package media and preselect
                      updating any packages that are newer than those
                      already installed. Great for just updating packages
                      using newer OS release or Repository CD without
                      reinstalling the operating system.
  fdimples /nofiles   turn off the file list when displaying packages to
                      have over-all better navigation performance.
